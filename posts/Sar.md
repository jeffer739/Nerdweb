i did a little research & found a known exploit for this which we'll use to exploit;

# Exploit Title: sar2html 3.2.1 - 'plot' Remote Code Execution

now we can get a reverse shell of course ðŸ˜‰

I got a copy of the pentest monkey php reverse shell to my local machine, then hosted a http python server & uploaded reverse shell with wget on victim machine;

now we can stablize the shell, get user.txt & enumerate to elevate privilege;

looking around, we find a crontab running that lets the root user to execute a finally.sh file which in turn executes a write.sh file.


Apparently we can't write to finally.sh file but can for write.sh 

So i uploaded a php reverse shell, edited the write.sh file to call my newly uploaded php reverse shell script which gives me a root shell after the crontabs runs.

And we can read root files even root.txt ðŸ˜‰
