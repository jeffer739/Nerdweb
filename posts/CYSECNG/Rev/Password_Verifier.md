Here we are given a go binary to reverse & get the flag,

I downloaded the binary, ran the binary but it asks for username & also password

 But here we don't know any password. i ran strings command on the binary,

confirmation binary is written in golang

And now we can see the binary is also packed using upx

Now reaserching about upx & we can see it is the ultimate packer for executables https://upx.github.io/

Now we just have to unpack using upx also

Now we see the ration, got decompressed 42.70% 

Now running the strings command again but this time grepping for the flag keyword "CYSEC"
