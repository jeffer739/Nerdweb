Visiting the web page

We have a lot going on already thanks to my 1337 l33t fwens haha

Now we can view the page source of the web page, we can also observe the comments in the code 

!-- /api?id=source --> This one being the standout comment

When we try to visit this /api endpoint with the id parameter & "source" value, we are able to download the source code of the web page 

now let's view the code

This code checks the body of every http requests we make to see if we give the id parameter the "gimme-flag" value else it tells us "I don't what you speak of, h4x0r!"

So with this idea i decided to use curl to make the request & get the flag for this web challenge ez

And we have our flag for this challenge :) I hope you enjoyed this one as i did ðŸ˜‰
